        <h1>Bio</h1>
        <p>
          Hello there! To be honest, I mainly made this site to experiment with
          Github pages and I thought the best way to do that was with a personal
          website. If you're interested, you can find a small section about me
          below.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently, I have three main passions that I work on while I search
          for a job. I love growing and cultivating plants, working on my
          restaurant app, and reading books (you can find a list of my top 5
          favorite books below).
        </p>
        <h1>Horticulture</h1>
        <p>
          As of now, I am raising a variety of plants, mostly herbs and one
          small avocado tree, my prized gem. My love for horticulture probably
          stems from this ideology I have where I believe that with enough daily
          effort, anyone can grow and accomplish anything. I find this to be
          analogous to the way that plants grow in that day to day, there might
          not be that much change; however, weeks, months, or years of daily,
          incremental growth adds up and brings you closer to your goal.
        </p>
        <h1>Yuzu Menu</h1>
        <p>
          Yuzu Menu is the name of an app that I am currently developing that
          combines the restaurant review aspect of Yelp and the social network
          of Instagram. My first
          <a href="https://yuzumenu-dev.firebaseapp.com/" target="_blank"
            >prototype</a
          >
          was a React app with the entire backend utilizing Firebase. I soon
          realized that Firebase could barely cover the scope of what I wanted
          to achieve so I decided to write my own backend. My current stack
          includes an Express server, MongoDB for data storage, Redis for
          caching, S3 for file storage, EC2 for hosting, GraphQL for backend
          APIs, and React for a web frontend. Before I deploy my product, I plan
          to use Docker to containerize my app and NGINX to handle the load
          balancing. Keep your eyes peeled for the release of Yuzu v2!
        </p>
        <h1>Books!</h1>
        <p>
          Books are a great way to get a lot of information in great detail in a
          short amount of time. Additionally, it's almost like you're talking
          directly to the author, even if it is entirely one sided! Here are my
          top 5 favorites.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Black Swan - Nicholas Nassim Taleb</li>
          <li>Zero to One - Peter Thiel</li>
          <li>Good to Great - James C. Collins</li>
          <li>Never Split The Difference - Chris Voss</li>
          <li>How to Win Friends and Influence People - Dale Carnegie</li>
